A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: a quantum computer exploits superposed and entangled states and the (non-deterministic) outcomes of quantum measurements as features of its computation. Ordinary (classical) computers operate, by contrast, using deterministic rules. Any classical computer can, in principle, be replicated using a (classical) mechanical device such as a Turing machine, with at most a constant-factor slowdown in timeâ€”unlike quantum computers, which are believed to require exponentially more resources to simulate classically.
